13.2.1: 
1.) to draw the route I would need the variables of origin, dest, and lat long. I would need to combine the flights and airports tables.

2.)The relationship between the two is using origin in the weather table and faa on the airports table.

3.) If weather contained records for all airports in the USA then it would have a link of dest with flights. 

13.4.6

1.)I do not know how to attach my map for this. But it is complete and in my R script file. 
2.)location of origin and destination were added to my DF again in my R script file. 
3.)There does not appear to be a relationship between plane age and the average delays of arrival.
